<div class = "txt_cluster">Bogo sort, while not necessarily a useful or effective sorting algorithm, is an interesting algorithm to learn in theory.
    Bogo sort is an algorithm used to sort the elements of an array by randomly generating different permutations of an array and then checking whether it is sorted or not. 
    It’s based on the generate-and-test paradigm</div>
    <em style="opacity: .7; font-size:40px;margin:10px;">How Does Bogo Sort Work?</em>
    <div class = "txt_cluster">Let’s assume that the array Arr[] = {2, 3, 1, 2, 4}  is to be sorted using bogo sort.
        First, we check if the array is already sorted.We then generate a random permutation of the array and check again if the array is sorted or not.
         This is repeated until we get a sorted array. </div>

         <div class = "txt_cluster">Question 1: Is bogo sort stable?
        
        
    
            <br>Question2: Why is using bogo sort not practical?
            <br>Answer Q1: No, bogo sort is not an example of a stable sorting algorithm, 
                as there is no guarantee that generated sorted permutations have the same relative order of elements of the same value as in the input or not. 
                <br>Answer Q2: Since the worst-case time complexity of bogo sort is O(infinite), there is no practical use of bogo sort.
